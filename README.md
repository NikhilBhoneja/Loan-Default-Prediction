# Loan-Default-Prediction
Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

Loan default is a significant issue that can have serious consequences for both borrowers (individuals or companies) and lenders (banks, financial institutions). 
When a borrower fails to repay a debt according to the initial agreement, it is considered a default. This can lead to various repercussions for the borrower, such as a drop 
in credit rating, asset withholding by financial institutions, legal consequences, and, in severe cases, bankruptcy. For lenders, a high volume of 'bad loans' can impact profitability, 
result in credit losses, and increase the risk of reducing equity, making it more challenging to issue new loans.

This project aims to address the critical issue of loan default by developing a robust prediction model with high accuracy. The goal is to enable banks to predict whether a borrower 
may default on their loan, utilizing a diverse set of factors for prediction.

## Objectives

- Develop a predictive model for loan default with high accuracy.
- Utilize a variety of factors to enhance the model's prediction capabilities.
- Provide a tool for banks and financial institutions to assess the risk of loan default.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluating the model contains information on historical loan data, including factors such as borrower details, loan terms, and repayment history. 
Dataset file is included in the file section.

## Implementation

The project leverages machine learning techniques to build a prediction model. The model considers multiple factors, including but not limited to borrower demographics, 
financial history, and loan terms. The goal is to create a reliable tool that aids in identifying potential loan defaulters early in the lending process.
